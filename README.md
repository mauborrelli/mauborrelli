# Iâ€™m currently working on ...
I am enthusiastic about data and statistics, so I joined a boot camp to improve my data science and analysis skills. I am ready to accept new challenges in emerging technology.
Since I am passionate about football video games, I have started a Python project that uses my newly acquired skills to gather and forecast player prices in the online game market. 
I aim to create a solution that automates game screenshots, utilizes AI for image recognition, and analyzes price trends.
