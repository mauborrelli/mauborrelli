# Iâ€™m currently working on ...
I am passionate about data and statistics, and I have chosen to enhance my Data Science and Analysis skills to embrace new challenges in emerging technology. I am finishing a boot camp in data science, and since I have a passion for football video games, utilizing my newly acquired skills, I have started a Python project to gather and forecast player prices in the online game market. 
I want to implement solutions to automate game snapshots, harness AI for image recognition, and examine price trends.
